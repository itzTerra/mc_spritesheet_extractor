With this script, you can extract textures from a **Minecraft spritesheet**, but with basic Python knowledge, you could easily make adjustments for you case.

There is also a function to recolor opaque pixels.

This is mainly useful for **modding**.

## Usage
1. Download or clone code
2. Adjust values in the example at the bottom of `main.py` according to your needs.
3. Run `main.py` with Python
4. Results will be in the `output` dir
   
## Getting MC textures
From the [Wiki](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Texture_atlas): 

You can get all spritesheets and coordinates with `F3+S` in-game (works at least 1.19.4 and above). They get saved into `.minecraft/screenshots/debug` folder.
